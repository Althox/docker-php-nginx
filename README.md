# Docker-PHP-NGINX
 Just a simple place to run PHP things.

 This is a dockerized environment with PHP running on NGINX. PHP comes installed with Composer so it should work with namespaces out of the box.

 Once the project has been build, enter the PHP container and run `composer install` to enable autoload and composer.

 Application is served on URL: http://localhost:8080/
